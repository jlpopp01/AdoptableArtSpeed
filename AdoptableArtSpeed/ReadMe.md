// This is the plan - 
            // Pull in Art from CSV
                //Read Art with StreamReader
            //Write Results with StreamWriter
                //save in it's own file
                //Literally which ever is easier. Seriously
            //Search for art by Artist, Availability, Technique
                //title - String 
                //artist - String
                //nationality - String
                //Technique - sting
                // Cost - Int
                //Available - Bool 
                //Add years if you have time and want another parameter

            // there will come a point where the above is necessary
            //if you are going to save it in a file on their hard drive ADD IT TO THE DANG README THATS RUDE OTHERWISE
