# AdoptableArtSpeed
C# Project for Adoptable Art from the Speed Museum

Welcome to my C# Project! In this project I have pulled data from the Speed Art Museum in Louisville, KY regarding their adoptable art which is art that needs help being restored. This is a console based app that will allow the user to search through adoptable art and see what it takes to restore them. 

Information about all art gathered from http://www.speedmuseum.org/collections/art_collection/adopt-an-artwork/
